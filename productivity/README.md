# Productivity Plugin

A productivity plugin for FashionUnited, designed for [Cowork](https://claude.com/product/cowork) and Claude Code. Task management across GitHub/beads/Vtiger, workplace memory with fashion industry context, and day planning around editorial deadlines and sales cycles.

## FashionUnited Configuration

This plugin is customized for FashionUnited's tool stack and workflows:
- **Google Workspace** for email, calendar, and documents
- **GitHub** for issues, projects (Now-Next-Later roadmap), and code
- **beads** for development issue tracking (`bd` CLI)
- **Vtiger CRM** for sales tasks and client management
- **Slack** for team communication

## Installation

```
claude plugins add knowledge-work-plugins/productivity
```

## What It Does

This plugin gives Claude a persistent understanding of your work:

- **Task management** — A markdown task list (`TASKS.md`) that Claude reads, writes, and executes against. Add tasks naturally, and Claude tracks status, triages stale items, and syncs with external tools.
- **Workplace memory** — A two-tier memory system that teaches Claude your shorthand, people, projects, and terminology. Say "ask todd to do the PSR for oracle" and Claude knows exactly who, what, and which deal.
- **Visual dashboard** — A local HTML file that gives you a board view of your tasks and a live view of what Claude knows about your workplace. Edit from the board or the file — they stay in sync.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/start` | Initialize tasks + memory, open the dashboard |
| `/update` | Triage stale items, check memory for gaps, sync from external tools if applicable |
| `/update --comprehensive` | Deep scan email, calendar, chat — flag missed todos and suggest new memories |

## Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `memory-management` | Two-tier memory system — CLAUDE.md for working memory, memory/ directory for deep storage |
| `task-management` | Markdown-based task tracking using a shared TASKS.md file |

## Example Workflows

### Getting Started

```
You: /start

Claude: [Creates TASKS.md, CLAUDE.md, memory/ directory, and dashboard.html]
        [Opens the dashboard in your browser]
        [Asks about your role, team, and current priorities to seed memory]
```

### Adding Tasks Naturally

```
You: I need to review the budget proposal for Sarah by Friday,
     draft the Q2 roadmap after syncing with Greg, and follow up
     on the API spec from the Platform team

Claude: [Adds all three tasks to TASKS.md with context]
        [Dashboard updates automatically]
```

### Morning Sync

```
You: /update --comprehensive

Claude: [Scans email, calendar, and chat for new action items]
        [Flags: "Budget proposal review is due tomorrow — still open"]
        [Suggests: "New person mentioned in 3 threads: Jamie Park,
         Design Lead — add to memory?"]
        [Updates stale tasks and fills memory gaps]
```

### Workplace Shorthand

Once memory is populated, Claude decodes your shorthand instantly:

```
You: ask todd to do the PSR for oracle

Claude: "Ask Todd Martinez (Finance lead) to prepare the Pipeline
         Status Report for the Oracle Systems deal ($2.3M, closing Q2)"
```

No clarifying questions. No round trips.
