# Memory Management

Memory makes Claude your workplace collaborator - someone who speaks your internal language.

## FashionUnited Context

FashionUnited is a global B2B fashion industry platform operating in 30+ markets. Key memory patterns:

- **Markets**: NL, DE, UK, US, FR, IT, ES, MX, IN, etc.
- **Products**: News platform, job board, B2B marketplace, company directory
- **Teams**: Editorial, Sales, Product, Engineering (Amsterdam HQ)
- **Tech stack**: Elixir/Phoenix, Next.js, Kubernetes/GCP

## The Goal

Transform shorthand into understanding:

```
User: "ask todd to do the PSR for oracle"
              ↓ Claude decodes
"Ask Todd Martinez (Finance lead) to prepare the Pipeline Status Report
 for the Oracle Systems deal ($2.3M, closing Q2)"
```

Without memory, that request is meaningless. With memory, Claude knows:
- **todd** → Todd Martinez, Finance lead, prefers Google Chat
- **PSR** → Pipeline Status Report (weekly sales doc)
- **oracle** → Oracle Systems deal, not the company

## Architecture

```
CLAUDE.md          ← Hot cache (~30 people, common terms)
memory/
  glossary.md      ← Full decoder ring (everything)
  people/          ← Complete profiles
  projects/        ← Project details
  context/         ← Company, teams, tools
```

**CLAUDE.md (Hot Cache):**
- Top ~30 people you interact with most
- ~30 most common acronyms/terms
- Active projects (5-15)
- Your preferences
- **Goal: Cover 90% of daily decoding needs**

**memory/glossary.md (Full Glossary):**
- Complete decoder ring - everyone, every term
- Searched when something isn't in CLAUDE.md
- Can grow indefinitely

**memory/people/, projects/, context/:**
- Rich detail when needed for execution
- Full profiles, history, context

## Lookup Flow

```
User: "ask todd about the PSR for phoenix"

1. Check CLAUDE.md (hot cache)
   → Todd? ✓ Todd Martinez, Finance
   → PSR? ✓ Pipeline Status Report
   → Phoenix? ✓ DB migration project

2. If not found → search memory/glossary.md
   → Full glossary has everyone/everything

3. If still not found → ask user
   → "What does X mean? I'll remember it."
```

This tiered approach keeps CLAUDE.md lean (~100 lines) while supporting unlimited scale in memory/.

## File Locations

- **Working memory:** `CLAUDE.md` in current working directory
- **Deep memory:** `memory/` subdirectory

## Working Memory Format (CLAUDE.md)

Use tables for compactness. Target ~50-80 lines total.

## How to Interact

### Decoding User Input (Tiered Lookup)

**Always** decode shorthand before acting on requests:

```
1. CLAUDE.md (hot cache)     → Check first, covers 90% of cases
2. memory/glossary.md        → Full glossary if not in hot cache
3. memory/people/, projects/ → Rich detail when needed
4. Ask user                  → Unknown term? Learn it.
```

Example:
```
User: "ask todd to do the PSR for oracle"

CLAUDE.md lookup:
  "todd" → Todd Martinez, Finance ✓
  "PSR" → Pipeline Status Report ✓
  "oracle" → (not in hot cache)

memory/glossary.md lookup:
  "oracle" → Oracle Systems deal ($2.3M) ✓

Now Claude can act with full context.
```

### Adding Memory

When user says "remember this" or "X means Y":

1. **Glossary items** (acronyms, terms, shorthand):
   - Add to memory/glossary.md
   - If frequently used, add to CLAUDE.md Quick Glossary

2. **People:**
   - Create/update memory/people/{name}.md
   - Add to CLAUDE.md Key People if important
   - **Capture nicknames** - critical for decoding

3. **Projects:**
   - Create/update memory/projects/{name}.md
   - Add to CLAUDE.md Active Projects if current
   - **Capture codenames** - "Phoenix", "the migration", etc.

4. **Preferences:** Add to CLAUDE.md Preferences section

### Recalling Memory

When user asks "who is X" or "what does X mean":

1. Check CLAUDE.md first
2. Check memory/ for full detail
3. If not found: "I don't know what X means yet. Can you tell me?"

### Progressive Disclosure

1. Load CLAUDE.md for quick parsing of any request
2. Dive into memory/ when you need full context for execution
3. Example: drafting an email to todd about the PSR
   - CLAUDE.md tells you Todd = Todd Martinez, PSR = Pipeline Status Report
   - memory/people/todd-martinez.md tells you he prefers Google Chat, is direct

## Bootstrapping

Use `/productivity:start` to initialize by scanning your chat, calendar, email, and documents. Extracts people, projects, and starts building the glossary.

## Conventions

- **Bold** terms in CLAUDE.md for scannability
- Keep CLAUDE.md under ~100 lines (the "hot 30" rule)
- Filenames: lowercase, hyphens (`todd-martinez.md`, `project-phoenix.md`)
- Always capture nicknames and alternate names
- Glossary tables for easy lookup
- When something's used frequently, promote it to CLAUDE.md
- When something goes stale, demote it to memory/ only

## What Goes Where

| Type | CLAUDE.md (Hot Cache) | memory/ (Full Storage) |
|------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Person | Top ~30 frequent contacts | glossary.md + people/{name}.md |
| Acronym/term | ~30 most common | glossary.md (complete list) |
| Project | Active projects only | glossary.md + projects/{name}.md |
| Nickname | In Key People if top 30 | glossary.md (all nicknames) |
| Company context | Quick reference only | context/company.md |
| Preferences | All preferences | - |
| Historical/stale | ✗ Remove | ✓ Keep in memory/ |

## Promotion / Demotion

**Promote to CLAUDE.md when:**
- You use a term/person frequently
- It's part of active work

**Demote to memory/ only when:**
- Project completed
- Person no longer frequent contact
- Term rarely used

This keeps CLAUDE.md fresh and relevant.
