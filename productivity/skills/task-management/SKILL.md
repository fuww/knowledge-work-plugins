# Task Management

Tasks are tracked across three systems optimized for different workflows:

1. **TASKS.md** - Personal tasks and commitments (quick capture, local file)
2. **GitHub Projects** - Team roadmap using Now-Next-Later columns
3. **beads** - Development issues and bugs (`bd` CLI)

## FashionUnited Context

FashionUnited operates across 30+ markets and 9 languages with key coordination patterns:

- **Editorial deadlines**: Content publishes in European morning (CET) for maximum reach
- **Sales cycles**: Monthly advertising deadlines, quarterly campaign planning
- **Multi-timezone**: Amsterdam HQ leads, coordinate with global markets
- **Weekly rhythm**: Monday planning, Thursday reviews, Friday async-only

## Local Tasks (TASKS.md)

**Always use `TASKS.md` in the current working directory.**

- If it exists, read/write to it
- If it doesn't exist, create it with the template below

## GitHub Projects Integration

For team-level work, use GitHub Projects with the **Now-Next-Later** roadmap structure:

| Column | Purpose | Typical items |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| **Now** | Currently in progress (this sprint/week) | Active features, urgent fixes |
| **Next** | Committed for next cycle | Prioritized backlog items |
| **Later** | Future consideration | Ideas, improvements, tech debt |

**Commands:**
- Check roadmap via `~~project tracker` (GitHub)
- Move items between columns as priorities shift
- Link issues to projects for tracking

## beads Integration

For development issues, use the `bd` CLI:

```bash
bd ready              # Find unblocked work
bd show <id>          # Full issue details
bd create "Title"     # New issue
bd close <id>         # Complete work
bd sync               # Sync with git
```

**Workflow:**
- Personal tasks in TASKS.md
- Development issues in beads
- Team roadmap in GitHub Projects

## Dashboard Setup (First Run)

A visual dashboard is available for managing tasks and memory. **On first interaction with tasks:**

1. Check if `dashboard.html` exists in the current working directory
2. If not, copy it from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/task-management/assets/dashboard.html` to the current working directory
3. Inform the user: "I've added the dashboard. Run `/productivity:start` to set up the full system."

The task board:
- Reads and writes to the same `TASKS.md` file
- Auto-saves changes
- Watches for external changes (syncs when you edit via CLI)
- Supports drag-and-drop reordering of tasks and sections

## Format & Template

When creating a new TASKS.md, use this exact template (without example tasks):

```markdown
# Tasks

## Active

## Waiting On

## Someday

## Done
```

Task format:
- `- [ ] **Task title** - context, for whom, due date`
- Sub-bullets for additional details
- Completed: `- [x] ~~Task~~ (date)`

## How to Interact

**When user asks "what's on my plate" / "my tasks":**
- Read TASKS.md
- Summarize Active and Waiting On sections
- Highlight anything overdue or urgent

**When user says "add a task" / "remind me to":**
- Add to Active section with `- [ ] **Task**` format
- Include context if provided (who it's for, due date)

**When user says "done with X" / "finished X":**
- Find the task
- Change `[ ]` to `[x]`
- Add strikethrough: `~~task~~`
- Add completion date
- Move to Done section

**When user asks "what am I waiting on":**
- Read the Waiting On section
- Note how long each item has been waiting

## Conventions

- **Bold** the task title for scannability
- Include "for [person]" when it's a commitment to someone
- Include "due [date]" for deadlines
- Include "since [date]" for waiting items
- Sub-bullets for additional context
- Keep Done section for ~1 week, then clear old items

### FashionUnited-specific conventions

- Tag editorial tasks with market codes (e.g., `[NL]`, `[DE]`, `[UK]`, `[US]`)
- Note timezone for cross-market deadlines (CET is default)
- Link to GitHub issues when task relates to development: `(#123)`
- Mark sales tasks with client/advertiser name

## Extracting Tasks

When summarizing meetings or conversations, offer to add extracted tasks:
- Commitments the user made ("I'll send that over")
- Action items assigned to them
- Follow-ups mentioned

Ask before adding - don't auto-add without confirmation.
