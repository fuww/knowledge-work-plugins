# Brand Voice Skill

Frameworks for documenting, applying, and enforcing brand voice and style guidelines across marketing content. Pre-configured with FashionUnited brand voice, editorial ethics, and multi-language content standards.

## FashionUnited Brand Voice

### Brand Personality
FashionUnited is the trusted voice of the fashion industry — a knowledgeable insider who explains industry developments clearly, celebrates innovation while maintaining journalistic objectivity, and treats all readers as respected professionals.

### Voice Attributes

| Attribute | We Are | We Are Not | Example |
|-----------|--------|------------|---------|
| Authoritative | Expert, well-researched, industry-leading | Arrogant, dismissive, inaccessible | "Industry data shows a 15% increase in sustainable material sourcing." |
| Accessible | Clear, jargon-free, welcoming | Dumbed-down, simplistic, condescending | "Here's what the new EU textile regulations mean for your business." |
| Professional | Business-appropriate, polished, reliable | Stuffy, overly formal, impersonal | "The collaboration brings together expertise in design and manufacturing." |
| Global | Culturally aware, inclusive, internationally minded | Regionally biased, insensitive, parochial | "Fashion weeks across Milan, Paris, and New York revealed common themes." |
| Timely | Current, news-driven, relevant | Stale, dated, out of touch | "Breaking: Major brand announces sustainability commitment ahead of COP." |

### Editorial Ethics Code

All FashionUnited content must adhere to these standards:

| Standard | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| Objectivity | Fact-based reporting, balanced coverage, no promotional bias in editorial |
| Attribution | Clear sourcing for all quotes, data, and claims |
| Separation | Clear distinction between editorial and sponsored/partner content |
| Embargoes | Respect for agreed publication dates with partners and sources |
| Conflicts | Disclosure of any relationships that could bias coverage |
| Accuracy | Verification of facts before publication, prompt corrections when needed |

## Brand Voice Documentation Framework

A complete brand voice document should cover these areas. Use this framework to help users define their brand voice or to understand an existing brand voice configuration.

### 1. Brand Personality
Define the brand as if it were a person. What are its defining traits?

Example: "If our brand were a person, they would be a knowledgeable colleague who explains complex things simply, celebrates your wins genuinely, and never talks down to you."

### 2. Voice Attributes
Select 3-5 attributes that define how the brand communicates. Each attribute should be defined with:
- What it means in practice
- What it does NOT mean (to prevent misinterpretation)
- An example demonstrating the attribute

### 3. Audience Awareness
- Who the brand is speaking to (primary and secondary audiences)
- What the audience cares about
- What level of expertise the audience has
- How the audience expects to be addressed

### 4. Core Messaging Pillars
- 3-5 key themes the brand consistently communicates
- The hierarchy of these messages (which comes first)
- How each pillar connects to audience needs

### 5. Tone Spectrum
How the voice adapts across contexts while remaining recognizably the same brand.

### 6. Style Rules
Specific grammar, formatting, and language rules. See the Style Guide Enforcement section below.

### 7. Terminology
Preferred and avoided terms. See the Terminology Management section below.

## Voice Attributes

### Common Voice Attribute Pairs

When defining brand voice, it helps to position attributes on a spectrum. Here are common attribute spectrums:

| Spectrum | One End | Other End |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| Formality | Formal, institutional | Casual, conversational |
| Authority | Expert, authoritative | Peer-level, collaborative |
| Emotion | Warm, empathetic | Direct, matter-of-fact |
| Complexity | Technical, precise | Simple, accessible |
| Energy | Bold, energetic | Calm, measured |
| Humor | Playful, witty | Serious, earnest |
| Innovation | Cutting-edge, forward-looking | Established, proven |

### Defining an Attribute

For each chosen attribute, document it in this format:

**[Attribute name]**
- **We are**: [what this means in practice]
- **We are not**: [common misinterpretation to avoid]
- **This sounds like**: [example sentence demonstrating the attribute]
- **This does NOT sound like**: [example sentence violating the attribute]

Example:

**Approachable**
- **We are**: friendly, clear, jargon-free, welcoming to beginners and experts alike
- **We are not**: dumbed-down, overly casual, or lacking substance
- **This sounds like**: "Here's how to get started — it takes about five minutes."
- **This does NOT sound like**: "Yo! This is super easy, even a noob can do it lol."

## Tone Adaptation Across Channels and Contexts

The brand voice stays consistent, but tone adapts to context. Tone is the emotional inflection applied to the voice.

### FashionUnited Tone by Channel

| Channel | Tone Adaptation | Example |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| News article | Journalistic, factual, objective | "The partnership brings together two industry leaders in sustainable manufacturing." |
| Newsletter | Curated, helpful, engaging | "This week's top stories: Fashion Week highlights and sustainability news." |
| Social (LinkedIn) | Professional, industry-focused, insightful | "Three takeaways from Première Vision that signal what's next for sustainable sourcing." |
| Social (Instagram) | Visual-first, trend-aware, engaging | "Behind the scenes at Milan Fashion Week. Swipe for our top moments." |
| Social (X/Twitter) | News-driven, concise, timely | "Breaking: Major brand announces circular fashion initiative." |
| Partnership content | Collaborative, value-focused, clearly labeled | "In partnership with [Partner]: How the industry is adapting to new regulations." |
| Press release | Formal, factual, newsworthy | "FashionUnited today announced the launch of..." |
| Job board content | Helpful, career-focused, encouraging | "Discover fashion industry careers that match your skills." |

### Tone by Situation

| Situation | Tone Adaptation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Product launch | Excited, confident, forward-looking |
| Incident or outage | Transparent, empathetic, accountable |
| Customer success story | Celebratory, specific, crediting the customer |
| Thought leadership | Authoritative, nuanced, evidence-based |
| Onboarding | Welcoming, encouraging, clear |
| Bad news (price increase, deprecation) | Honest, respectful, solution-oriented |
| Competitive comparison | Confident but fair, fact-based, not disparaging |

### Tone Adaptation Rule
The voice attributes remain fixed. Tone dials them up or down based on context. For example, if a brand is "bold and warm":
- In a product launch, dial up boldness
- In an incident response, dial up warmth
- Neither attribute disappears; the balance shifts

## Style Guide Enforcement

### Grammar and Mechanics
Document and enforce these choices consistently:

| Rule | Options | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Oxford comma | Yes / No | "fast, reliable, and secure" vs. "fast, reliable and secure" |
| Sentence case vs. title case (headings) | Sentence / Title | "How to get started" vs. "How to Get Started" |
| Contractions | Use / Avoid | "we're" vs. "we are" |
| Em dash spacing | No spaces / Spaces | "this—and more" vs. "this — and more" |
| Numbers | Spell out 1-9, numerals 10+ / Always numerals | "five features" vs. "5 features" |
| Percent | % / percent | "50%" vs. "50 percent" |
| Date format | Month DD, YYYY / DD/MM/YYYY / etc. | "January 15, 2025" |
| Time format | 12-hour / 24-hour | "3:00 PM" vs. "15:00" |
| Lists | Periods / No periods on fragments | "Set up your account." vs. "Set up your account" |

### Formatting Conventions
- Heading hierarchy (when to use H1, H2, H3)
- Bold and italic usage (bold for emphasis, italic for titles/terms)
- Link text (descriptive vs. "click here" — always descriptive)
- Image alt text requirements
- Code formatting (for technical brands)
- Callout or highlight box usage

### Punctuation and Emphasis
- Exclamation mark policy (limited use, never more than one)
- Ellipsis usage (avoid in most professional contexts)
- ALL CAPS policy (avoid; use bold for emphasis instead)
- Emoji usage by channel (professional channels: minimal or none; social: where appropriate)
