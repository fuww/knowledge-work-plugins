# Fashion Seasonal Cycles

Understanding fashion industry timing, from design to retail, including content planning cycles and data analysis considerations.

## Fashion Season Overview

The fashion industry operates on seasons, with collections planned 12-18 months ahead and shown 6 months before retail availability.

### Main Seasons

| Season | Abbreviation | Retail Period | Shows/Presentations |
|--------|--------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Spring/Summer | SS, S/S | March - August | September (prior year) |
| Autumn/Winter | AW, A/W, FW, F/W | September - February | February (same year) |

**Naming convention:** SS26 = Spring/Summer 2026 (shown September 2025, retail Spring 2026)

### Inter-Seasons (Pre-Collections)

| Season | Retail Period | Presentations | Purpose |
|--------|---------------|---------------|---------|
| Pre-Fall | June - August | December - January | Bridge between SS and AW |
| Resort/Cruise | November - January | May - June | Holiday and travel wear |

**Key notes:**
- Pre-collections often have longer retail life (earlier delivery, longer on floor)
- Resort/Cruise increasingly important for revenue (warmer-climate markets)
- Some brands combine pre-collections with main collections
